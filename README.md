# **Access to Electricity**

**Author:** TINOK-SYS  
**Language:** English (with Italian comments)  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

## Overview
This project analyzes the global evolution of access to electricity using data from the **World Bank**.  
It explores differences between regions, identifies trends over time, and visualizes progress toward universal access.

## Project Structure
1. **Dataset description**
2. **Exploratory analysis**
3. **Data selections and sorting**
4. **Feature engineering (apply + lambda)**
5. **Visualizations (histogram, boxplot, scatterplot, barplot, lineplot)**
6. **Conclusions and future work**

## Key Insights
- Global access to electricity has improved significantly over the last decades.  
- Strong disparities persist between regions Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind.  
- Developed regions have nearly universal access.

## Future Work
- Combine with socioeconomic indicators.  
- Build predictive models to forecast future access.  
- Create an interactive dashboard (Plotly or Streamlit).
